    <h1>PPP Fraud Complaint – Core Versatility LLC</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <p>My name is <strong>Jimmi Kendrick</strong>, and I am the founder and 50% co-owner of <strong>Core Versatility LLC</strong>. I am submitting this complaint to formally report criminal fraudulent activity involving a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan issued under Core Versatility LLC.</p>
      <p>Despite my equal ownership, my former business partner, <strong>Maria Onesimo</strong>, fraudulently applied for and obtained a PPP loan without my knowledge, authorization, or consent. I never signed any application documents nor was I consulted, even though my name is on the Articles of Organization as co-owner.</p>

      <h2>Evidence of Fraudulent Loan</h2>
      <p><strong>Loan Number:</strong> 9594798110<br>
      <strong>Date:</strong> July 28, 2020<br>
      <strong>Lender:</strong> B:Side (formerly Colorado Lending Source, Ltd.).<br>
      <strong>Borrower Listed:</strong> Core Versatility LLC<br>
      <strong>Loan Amount:</strong> $20,325.00</p>
      <p>I did not authorize or participate in this loan application, which was filed solely by Maria Onesimo.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="emails">
      <h2>Email Correspondence Evidence</h2>
      <p>The following screenshots demonstrate direct communication between <strong>Maria Onesimo</strong> and <strong>Max Edja</strong> of <strong>D&amp;E Business Consulting</strong>, revealing their deliberate efforts to exclude me from the PPP loan process despite my 50% ownership of Core Versatility LLC.</p>

      <img src="1 Email Evident Screenshot  Maria Onisemo Convo between  Edja Max.png" alt="Email Screenshot 1" class="email-img">
      <img src="2 Email Evident Screenshot  Maria Onisemo Convo between  Edja Max.png" alt="Email Screenshot 2" class="email-img">
      <img src="3 Email Evident Screenshot  Maria Onisemo Convo between  Edja Max.png" alt="Email Screenshot 3" class="email-img">

      <p>These emails show the accountant <strong>Max Edja</strong> communicating directly with <strong>Maria Onesimo</strong> about the SBA application (No. 3309015886). Maria confirms that the Colorado Lending Source form only listed her name and excluded mine, while Max Edja responded dismissively, confirming the disbursement process and advising her to proceed with the loan despite my co-ownership.</p>

    <section class="request">
      <h2>Request for Action</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Investigate this matter as PPP loan fraud.</li>
        <li>Determine the legality of the loan application.</li>
        <li>Hold <strong>Maria Onesimo</strong>, <strong>Max Edja</strong> / <strong>D&amp;E Business (accountant)</strong>, and all responsible parties fully accountable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I have already reported this incident to <strong>B:Side</strong> (formerly Colorado Lending Source Ltd.), the institution currently managing the loan, by emailing <a href="mailto:Kwilliams@bside.org">Kwilliams@bside.org</a>. Additionally, I contacted the <strong>Small Business Administration</strong> via <a href="mailto:Steven.White@sba.gov">Steven.White@sba.gov</a> to report this criminal act. Unfortunately, I have yet to receive a response. I am including this report to prevent further fraudulent actions by <strong>Maria Onesimo</strong> and to ensure accountability for these ongoing schemes.</p>
      <p>This represents not only a fraud against me as co-owner, but also a fraud against the federal government, resulting in the unlawful obtainment of over $20,000 in federal relief funds.</p>
